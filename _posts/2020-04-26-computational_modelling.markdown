<h1>{{ Kidney-on-a-chip | downcase }}</h1>

The kidney is one of the most complicated organs in the human body. It, therefore,

presents an enormous challenge for researchers to develop a platform of “kidney-on-
a-chip” that can mimic its function when exposed to various drugs and medications.

An on-chip nephron device made out of a single multilayered polymer construct
has been proposed by Weinberg et al. The chip resembles the functioning
nephron with three sections, viz. the glomerulus, the proximal tubule and the loop
of Henle and is made up of two microfabricated layers separated by a membrane.
The filtration of the glomerular unit, the reabsorption in the tubule, and the large
increase in urea concentration in the loop of Henle were all observed when a blood
sample was introduced into the on-chip nephron device. This was one of the first
attempts in the field. Though it was a successful attempt, there were challenges to
be addressed related to the culture and control of the various cell types and the
filtration process for the separation of waste was not as efficient as for the normal
nephron.
