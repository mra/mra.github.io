**Existing organ-on-chip models**

**Kidney-on-a-chip**
<p style="text-align:justify">The kidney is one of the most complicated organs in the human body. It, therefore,
presents an enormous challenge for researchers to develop a platform of “kidney-on-
a-chip” that can mimic its function when exposed to various drugs and medications.</centre></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">An on-chip nephron device made out of a single multilayered polymer construct
has been proposed by Weinberg et al. The chip resembles the functioning
nephron with three sections, viz. the glomerulus, the proximal tubule and the loop
of Henle and is made up of two microfabricated layers separated by a membrane.
The filtration of the glomerular unit, the reabsorption in the tubule, and the large
increase in urea concentration in the loop of Henle were all observed when a blood
sample was introduced into the on-chip nephron device. This was one of the first
attempts in the field. Though it was a successful attempt, there were challenges to
be addressed related to the culture and control of the various cell types and the
filtration process for the separation of waste was not as efficient as for the normal
nephron.</p>



**Human breathing-lung-on-a-chip**
<p style="text-align:justify">The lung-on-a-chip is a complex, three-dimensional model of a living, breathing
human lung on a microchip. The device is made using human lung and blood
vessel cells and it can predict absorption of airborne nanoparticles and mimic the
inflammatory response triggered by microbial pathogens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently two research groups have come up with lung-on-chip. The alveolus
lung-chip emulates fundamental lung functions of the alveolus, such as gas exchange
and absorption. It has been used in a range of applications, including evaluation of
nanoparticle absorption and toxicity, study of disease development and assessment
of adverse drug effects, such as pulmonary edema and pulmonary thrombosis. The
airway lung-chip (AwLC) recapitulates the physiology and function of the airway
epithelium, which conducts inhaled air to the alveolar air sacs.</p>

**Pancreas-on-a-chip**

<p style="text-align:justify"> The design of the islet-on-a-chip was inspired by the human pancreas, in which
islands of cells (“islets”) receive a continuous stream of information about glucose
levels from the bloodstream and adjust their insulin production as needed.
Before transplanting beta cells into a patient, they must be tested to see whether
they are functioning properly. The current method for doing this is based on
technology from the 1970s: giving the cells glucose to elicit an insulin response,
collecting samples, adding reagents and taking measurements to see how much
insulin is present in each one. The manual process being highly time consuming
to run and interpret may cause clinicians to not pursue it. The new, automated,
miniature device gives results in real time enables speeding up clinical decision
making.</p>

**Foetal membranes-on-a-chip**
<p style="text-align:justify">Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of premature death in new-borns and
children under the age of five. While the causes and the process triggering PTB
are still not understood, 70% of the PTB cases have been correlated with bacterial
infection of the foetal membrane, so called “chorioamnionitis” (CAM). CAM
does not lead to premature rupture of the foetal membranes (PPROM) and this is
possibly due to the innate maternal and foetal response. In order to clarify the
origin of PPROM and the spatio-temporal progress of CAM a new human model
of the foetal membranes are developed where bacterial infection and propagation
through the foetal membrane can be observed and studied.</p>

 **Proposed multi Organ-on-Chip**

The design of the MOOC is proposed to mimic the
structure and function of adipocytes and macrophages
as adipose-tissue-on-chip (VATOC and SATOC) and β-
cells and PDECs on IOC, as in FIG.

![Overview of MOOC]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/overview_mooc.png)

Each OOC comprises of two-cell culture chambers and a thin layer of porous membrane and are interconnected through the
wells in each chip, allowing fluid flow between the chips.
In ATOC, adipocytes (in VATOC, visceral adipocytes
and in SATOC, subcutaneous adipocytes) are cultured in
the top chamber and macrophages in the bottom cham-
ber along with epithelial and endothelial cells as in FIG
5a. These macrophages are involved in obesity-associated
islet inflammation and are responsible for various func-
tions such as decreasing insulin secretion from β-cells and
stimulating β-cell proliferation. This dominant immune
cell type in IoL modulates β-cell function in obese indi-
viduals. In IOC, β-cells of the islets of pancreas, which
are normally resident in the IoL are cultured with PDECs
5b. The sampling can be done for the following, and mod-
elling is performed: i) adipokines (leptin, adiponectin,
adipsin), ii) pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α),
iii) anti-inflammatory factors (IL-1 receptor antagonist,
IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, and IL-13), iv) insulin and v) glucose
The metabolic activities described above will result in
the generation of waste products. In the absence of an
excretory system, it would be necessary to remove the
waste products through filtration so that they do not
impair the functioning of the OOCs.

MOOC may aid the study of mechanisms that regu-
late β-cell adaptation to obesity and the pathways me-
diating the crosstalk between AT and β-cells. By ad-
ministering a pulse of glucose into the top chamber of
ATOC, inter-tissue effects of
adipocytes on β-cell, direct effects of leptin, adiponectin
and adipsin on the islet function, local effects of other
adipokines can be studied and validated [13]. The change
in key metabolites in time-series can be understood by
the untargeted metabolomics approach. This can ulti-
mately lead to a better understanding of the association
of obesity-linked visceral and ectopic fat accumulation
leading to the pathogenesis of diabetes [12].
As paracrine effects are sensitive it is not feasible to
monitor and quantify the release of small concentration
of substrates visually. With MOOC, this can be achieved
to a great extent
