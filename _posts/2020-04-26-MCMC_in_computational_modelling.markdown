**MCMC**
<p style="text-align:justify">
Recently I happend to watch a movie "Thappad" meaning "a slap".
First of all I would like to forcefully say that 'it is not just a slap'. The message conveyed is not just about the domestic violence women suffers but also the extreme emotional stress they have to face. The movie climax shakes the roots of patriarchal society. I am really empowered with the message conveyed in the movie. May be because I had strong feelings hidden inside me, out of experiences that says women deserves better in all aspects of life. The movie points out that it is the mistake of the mothers and grandmothers who make women believe that everything is okay in a marriage. But even one slap is outrageous and is not okay.
If we can't integrate something, approximate it by sampling.
MCMC is a sampler </p>
