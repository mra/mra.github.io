**Multi Organ-on-Chip**

The design of the MOOC is proposed to mimic the
structure and function of adipocytes and macrophages
as adipose-tissue-on-chip (VATOC and SATOC) and β-
cells and PDECs on IOC, as in FIG.

![Overview of MOOC](/images/overview_mooc.png)

 Each OOC comprises of two-cell culture chambers and a thin layer of porous membrane and are interconnected through the
wells in each chip, allowing fluid flow between the chips.
In ATOC, adipocytes (in VATOC, visceral adipocytes
and in SATOC, subcutaneous adipocytes) are cultured in
the top chamber and macrophages in the bottom cham-
ber along with epithelial and endothelial cells as in FIG
5a. These macrophages are involved in obesity-associated
islet inflammation and are responsible for various func-
tions such as decreasing insulin secretion from β-cells and
stimulating β-cell proliferation. This dominant immune
cell type in IoL modulates β-cell function in obese indi-
viduals. In IOC, β-cells of the islets of pancreas, which
are normally resident in the IoL are cultured with PDECs
5b. The sampling can be done for the following, and mod-
elling is performed: i) adipokines (leptin, adiponectin,
adipsin), ii) pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α),
iii) anti-inflammatory factors (IL-1 receptor antagonist,
IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, and IL-13), iv) insulin and v) glucose
The metabolic activities described above will result in
the generation of waste products. In the absence of an
excretory system, it would be necessary to remove the
waste products through filtration so that they do not
impair the functioning of the OOCs.

MOOC may aid the study of mechanisms that regu-
late β-cell adaptation to obesity and the pathways me-
diating the crosstalk between AT and β-cells. By ad-
ministering a pulse of glucose into the top chamber of
ATOC, inter-tissue effects of
adipocytes on β-cell, direct effects of leptin, adiponectin
and adipsin on the islet function, local effects of other
adipokines can be studied and validated [13]. The change
in key metabolites in time-series can be understood by
the untargeted metabolomics approach. This can ulti-
mately lead to a better understanding of the association
of obesity-linked visceral and ectopic fat accumulation
leading to the pathogenesis of diabetes [12].
As paracrine effects are sensitive it is not feasible to
monitor and quantify the release of small concentration
of substrates visually. With MOOC, this can be achieved
to a great extent
