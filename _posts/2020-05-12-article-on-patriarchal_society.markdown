**It's not just a slap**
<p style="text-align:justify">
Recently I happend to watch a movie "Thappad" meaning "a slap".HIII
First of all I would like to forcefully say that 'it is not just a slap'. The message conveyed is not just about the domestic violence women suffers but also the extreme emotional stress they have to face. The movie climax shakes the roots of patriarchal society. I am really empowered with the message conveyed in the movie. May be because I had strong feelings hidden inside me, out of experiences that says women deserves better in all aspects of life. The movie points out that it is the mistake of the mothers and grandmothers who make women believe that everything is okay in a marriage. But even one slap is outrageous and is not okay. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Women are destined to believe that they are not suffering from domestic violence even when they are not really happy living the life they are in. The emotional attachment and the way of upbringing, grand nannies and nannas advices of female sacrifices- these shape the minds of women. They are made to believe that they are meant to make homes. Not even thinking about a career or a way of life for themselves they fall into the traps of relationships mostly arranged marriages. The fear of being left alone, the fear of what others would say, the fear of children's future- these restrict them from even thinking otherwise.
Girls child should be brought up with dignity and pride for being a girl. Let her conquer the world. I have seen parents teaching girl child the bulk of traditions and hone making cultures which are biased towards the boy child. My request to these parents esp. mothers is that you don't know what it feels like to be independent but never teach your child to be the same and follow your path. Allow children to follow their dreams. Understand that marriage is just a choice. Happiness and self respect should be given utost importance in everyone's life.
She/he should be respected irrespective of sex. The equality should be everywhere and it should start with your thoughts and end with your actions.</p>
